The simple coupled atmosphere-ocean model developed by Battisti is used to evaluate the predictability of ENSO. Singular vector analysis is employed. To identify the roles of the annual cycle and the interannual ENSO cycle in determining the model predictive skill and error growth, we examine the optimal perturbation growth about several reference trajectories. We systematically investigate the relationship between the model forecast skill and optimal error growth for 6-month integrations about the actual model forecast trajectory for the period of record 1967-90.In most of the cases investigated, there is only one structure that grows. The optimal perturbation growth is highly dependent on the phase of both the seasonal cycle and the ENSO cycle, and it is strongly dependent on the duration over which the perturbations are evolved. The maximum perturbation growth is achieved for integrations that pass through Northern summer, and the minimum growth takes place for integrations spanning Northern winter-early spring. The optimal perturbation growth for a 6-month integration starting in the peak phase or the cold phase of the ENSO cycle is generally small. The physical processes responsible for the phase dependence are identified. The initial and the final state patterns of the optimal perturbation, however, are both insensitive to the phase of the annual cycle and freely evolving ENSO cycle, and to the particular regions of phase space visited by the system. The structure of the optimal perturbation consists of an east-west dipole spanning the entire tropical Pacific basin, superimposed on a north-south dipole in the eastern tropical Pacific, and this structure has a simple physical interpretation.There is a strong negative correlation between this model's forecast skill and the optimal error growth about the actual forecast trajectories, implying that the optimal error growth is in practice a useful indicator of the skill of the forecasts. Importantly, a large portion of the forecast error may be accounted for by the growth of the optimal errors in the sea surface temperature in the initial conditions alone. This suggests a need for a higher accuracy in observations of equatorial sea surface temperature. On the other hand, in about 4% of the forecasts, the optimal error growth in SST alone is insufficient to explain the poor forecast skill, suggesting that for these extreme cases, there are possible serious flaws in the model physics.Finally, the seasonality of the model forecast skill and the optimal error growth exhibits a phase shift of 2-3 months from the pre-1976 to the post-1976 epochs. This decadal change is largely determined by the change in the actual forecast trajectories about which the errors are allowed to develop and not by a decadal change in the average annual cycle.

The link between the zonal wind stress at the latitude of Drake Passage and the production of deep water in the Northern Hemisphere is explored. A nearly linear response to wind stress at the tip of South America is seen in northern deep water production rates in both one- and two-basin configurations. Transient studies are conducted that illustrate the transmission of the wind generated signal from the Southern Hemisphere to the northern sinking region.Mixed-boundary condition experiments are conducted in a number of model configurations. Deep-decoupling oscillations are produced in a one-hemisphere configuration, but can be suppressed by representing the influence of AABW by restoring the bottom temperatures to appropriate values. In two-hemisphere numerical experiments, the continuous production of AABW is seen to prevent the destabilization of the high northern latitudes, and deep-decoupling oscillations do not occur. In a two-basin configuration, the export of fresh water from the Atlantic basin during a colder climate allows century-scale deep-decoupling oscillations.The results of the OGCM mixed boundary condition experiments are investigated using simple box models. One-hemisphere circulations are generated that are consistent with the 3-D model, and the influence of deep restoring is explored. Deep-decoupling oscillations can only be produced in a two-hemisphere box model if boundary and initial conditions do not allow AABW production. Multiple equilibria are found in the overturning circulation.Two scenarios are presented to produce oscillations that are similar to deep-decoupling oscillations in the presence of continued AABW production. First, the high northern latitudes are subjected to a melt pulse/retreat pattern of freshening. These perturbations can cause transitions from one stable mode to another, as well as overturning flushes that are followed by a return to the original stable overturning mode. Second, stochastic forcing is applied to the high northern latitude surface fresh water flux. The variations in surface forcing are capable of producing transitions between overturning states that are similar to deep-decoupling oscillations. The stochastic forcing acts to overcome the stabilizing effect of the AABW. In two-basin mixed boundary condition experiments, cooling the climate is seen to result in deep-decoupling type oscillations under stochastic forcing that produced no such variability in a warmer climate."

The three products are: U.S. Navy, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and U.S. National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Vector winds, wind speed, divergence, pseudo-stress, and curl of pseudo-stress are compared for the period of 1985–1995. There is good agreement between the products in the Northern Hemisphere extra-tropics. In the tropics, along the west coast of the Americas, and over poorly observed regions of the Southern Hemisphere, the agreement between products can be very limited, especially for derived quantities like divergence or curl of pseudo-stress. There are large differences in the divergence within the Pacific Intertropical Convergence Zone, and in zonal winds in the Southern Hemisphere westerlies. Climatologies of 1985–1995 compare much better than do anomalies, as expected. To assess whether modifications during this period to the data assimilation techniques and models used to generate the wind products resulted in better agreement between the products, the first and last 5 years are compared separately. The agreement between products during the last 5 years is improved in some areas, but is worse in others."
